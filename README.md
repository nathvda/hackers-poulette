# hackers-poulette

## Welcome to this repository ! 
This repository is another project I realized for BeCode. I made it using OOPHP as well as SASS and javascript. The goal is to make a form to retrieve comments from user and allow the administrator to manage those comments. I still need to implement a mailing system to confirm that the comment has been received and deploy the website properly.

## Who am I ?

I'm a junior developer in training at BeCode, trying to get a good grip on php with projects and other things. I am currently in training at BeCode and do this as part of my training. 

## When ?

The project was started on January 30th 2023.
